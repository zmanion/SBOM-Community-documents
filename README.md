# SBOM Community Document Repository

This repository holds copies of various documents drafted collaboratively by the [CISA SBOM Community](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) and through the [NTIA Multistakeholder Process on Software Component Transparency](https://www.ntia.gov/other-publication/2021/ntia-software-component-transparency). Some very closely related documents (such as translations) are also included.

### The Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

This is an official report produced by the U.S. government and not developed by the NTIA Multistakeholder Process community.

The Executive Order (14028) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity directs the Department of Commerce, in coordination with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to publish the “minimum elements” for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
