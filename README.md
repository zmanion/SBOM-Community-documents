## SBOM

### SBOM Sharing Primer

This document provides examples of how software bill of materials (SBOM) can be shared between different actors across the software supply chain. It focuses on the processes and mechanisms for sharing SBOMs, assuming one party has created an SBOM and another party wants to access it. Additionally, this document builds upon the “SBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report,” and the “SBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations” document drafted by the CISA facilitated Sharing and Exchanging SBOM community-driven workstream.

### Survey of Existing SBOM Formats and Standards

The original survey was published in late 2019, after drafts were reviewed by the broader NTIA community. As the SBOM community grew, and implementation increased, the original working group expanded its focus to highlight the benefits of the SBOM tooling ecosystem, and the value of coordinating and harmonizing across the technical SBOM world. As part of this effort, the working group observed that, by 2021, parts of the document were out of date or less relevant. This 2021 revision offers several improvements on the original draft, and should be considered the stakeholder consensus until further updated. A key takeaway—that the baseline SBOM data can be conveyed in any of the formats described below, and the ecosystem can and should support interoperability between these data formats—holds for this revised document.
