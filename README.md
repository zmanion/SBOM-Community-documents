### Survey of Existing SBOM Formats and Standards

The original survey was published in late 2019, after drafts were reviewed by the broader NTIA
community. As the SBOM community grew, and implementation increased, the original working
group expanded its focus to highlight the benefits of the SBOM tooling ecosystem, and the
value of coordinating and harmonizing across the technical SBOM world. As part of this effort,
the working group observed that, by 2021, parts of the document were out of date or less
relevant. This 2021 revision offers several improvements on the original draft, and should be
considered the stakeholder consensus until further updated. A key takeaway—that the baseline
SBOM data can be conveyed in any of the formats described below, and the ecosystem can
and should support interoperability between these data formats—holds for this revised
document.
