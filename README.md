# SBOM Community Document Repository

This repository holds copies of various documents drafted collaboratively by the [CISA SBOM Community](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) and through the [NTIA Multistakeholder Process on Software Component Transparency](https://www.ntia.gov/other-publication/2021/ntia-software-component-transparency). Some very closely related documents (such as translations) are also included.

Documents mirrored in this repository are primarily sourced from the CISA [SBOM Resources Library](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/sbom/sbomresourceslibrary) and the NTIA [Software Bill of Materials](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials) page. Document summaries are also largely adapted from the CISA and NTIA sources.

### The Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

This is an official report produced by the U.S. government and not developed by the NTIA Multistakeholder Process community.

The Executive Order (14028) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity directs the Department of Commerce, in coordination with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to publish the “minimum elements” for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

### SBOM FAQ

#### 2024 Edition

Provides information on the benefits of SBOM, common misconceptions and concerns, creation of an SBOM, distributing and sharing an SBOM, and role specific guidance. Also, the document provides information on SBOM related efforts, such as Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX), OpenC2, and digital bill of materials (DBOM).
